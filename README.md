### ASSIGNMENT

    Using data from https://api.mockaroo.com/api/6352abc0?count=5&key=632d7f80:
      *Create a Javascript file that describes the data using the appropriate data types
      *In the same file, making sure each person is represented by an object in an array:
        **Is the first person older than the last person?
        **Does the 2nd person have the same amount of kids as the 3rd?
      *Create a statement that checks if the 1st person and the 4th person in the array both know how to program. If yes, output “Yay!”, if not output “LMGTFY”.
      *Create a statement that checks the 2nd person in the array for their nationality. If the person’s country is Iceland, output “Hæ”, if he/she is from Spain output “Hola”, if he/she is from Korea output “여보세요”). If the country is none of the above, output “Hello”. Tip: a switch statement might be a good fit for this task.
      *Use a ternary operator to output if the 2nd person’s name is longer than 5 characters.
